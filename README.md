You will need to copy this markdown, create your own private gist, and paste this markdown in your own gist. After each project, you will take time to come back to your private gist and answer each of the questions that are outlined for you below.

Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
This project runs a text based game that will run through a sequence of trivia questions, asking for an answer each time. 
it runs multiple rounds, with a new question each time, and will track scores and guessing accuracy.

Reflection Questions:
1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?
    - I start by reading all available information, and write some tests to check my code as I go. I usually try a couple experiments, to see if I can make it work by using tools or methods that I'm already familiar with. If I don't figure out a solution this way, it at least helps point me in the right direction, for what I need to google. I google for things based off of what I've run into with my experimenting; ie. methods I might use, why things are interacting in a specific way, etc. If I'm still having issues, I start reaching out to the rest of the cohort or other support that's available to me.
2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?
    - When I really start to feel like I'm up against a wall and making no progress, the best thing I've found to do so far is to just walk away for a bit. even if it's just 15-30 minutes of doing something else and I'll start to see issues with my code that I was missing before. 
3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?
    - I spent at least 2 hours trying to solve a single problem. I was working with an instance object, I needed to be able to push that object into an array, and still register as an Instance of the Turn class. I wasn't really understanding implicit return so I kept trying to google things, with very little results, and even reached out to the cohort for help. I ended up giving up for the night and just trying to get a good nights sleep, this worked because it helped refresh my brain and also it gave people more time to respond to me and help me learn what I was missing; an understanding of implicit return.
4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?
    - TDD is the only way I was really able to wrap my head around what was expected of me with this project. only having the pry interactions told me what we wanted to be able to do with the files, but not how to do it. TDD helped me plan my approach, organize the components I needed to make, and ensure that each block was working as intended!
